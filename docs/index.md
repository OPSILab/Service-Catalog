Service Catalogue provides all functionality to register, model, map and publish and manage all the information needed to support the uses of service (public&private) according to the following three points of view:

- Informational
- Service Invocation
- Semantic interoperability & Personal Data Governance

The catalogue enables the storage and publishing of service by providing general, technical and data processing information based on standard models ( e.g. [ISA2 CPSV-AP](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/semantic-interoperability-community-semic/solution/core-public-service-vocabulary-application-profile/about) ).

Service Catalogue is an open source software developed by
[Engineering Ingegneria Informatica SpA](http://www.eng.it) inside the EU founded project [ACROSS](https://across-h2020.eu/).
